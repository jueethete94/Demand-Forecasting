# Demand-Forecasting

In simple words — predicting the future demand of a product/service.

Demand forecasting is very important area of supply chain because rest of the planning of entire supply chain depends on it. for example-Production planning (scheduling, personal planning), Inventory(warehouses), Finance(budget planning,plant/equipment investment), Marketing(promotion, new production planning), Raw material planning etc. Demand forecast is the basis of all strategic and planning decsions of supply chain beacuse they reduce the uncertainty.

## Demand forecasting methods :
Qualitative-
In this method the prediction mostly rely on humand judgment.
Most appropriate when little historical data is available or when experts have market intelligence that may affect the forecast.
### 2. Time Series-
Uses historical demand to make forecast
Based on the assumption that past demand history is a good indicator of future demand
### 3. Causal-
This method assume that the demand forecast is highly correlated with certain factors in the enviornment(interest rates,price of oils etc)
Causal demand forecasting methods finds this corelation between demand and theses enviornmental factors and use estimates of what enviornmental factors will be to forecast future demand.
# Why do we want apply Monte Carlo Simulation ?
All of the above forecasting methods will give us the point estimates (Deterministic models) of future demand. If we want to find different possible outcomes and the likelihood they will occur we can do this by using MCS. It can help us to assess the likelihood of meeting target goals. We can plan our safety stock of Inventory better. We can get a range of minimum and maximum level — it will help in supply chain planning decisions as we know the range in which our demand may fluctuate-hence reduces the uncertanity.
